As "mentioned on the WISP wiki":http://wisp.wikispaces.com/Getting+firmware+and+software, this is the _community fork_ of the DL WISP 4.1 firmware.  New development happens in this fork.  The original version of this firmware is archived in a "Subversion repository":https://svn.seattle.intel-research.net/repos/wisp_challenge at Intel Research Seattle.

For more information about WISP, refer to the "WISP wiki":http://wisp.wikispaces.com/.

The initial import of the Subversion repository into this Github project occurred on September 21, 2010.
